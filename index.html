								Think Marketing Material have worked with IVC from the outset to supply the group with 
								<span style="color:#07B5F2">cost effective stationery and marketing material - including leaflets, brochures, welcome packs, carrier bags and much more - as well as signage,</span> 
								which we have installed at  a large number of IVC Practices throughout the UK, to make them more visible and increase client awareness.
								<br/><br/>
								Think also run the IVC print website - see user guide attached - which allows you to re-order all items we produce after the first time you order from us. All items ordered through this website are invoiced centrally through the IVC Finance Department which also cuts down on lengthy admin work for you.
								<br/></br/>
								<span style="color:#07B5F2">
									For printed matter, we provide most artwork we do for you absolutely <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">free of charge.</span>
								</span>
								<br/><br/>
									A copy of our Team Chart is attached so you know who is who - but if you want to place any orders by e mail or for advice and general enquiries just e mail <a href="#" title="send email to ian@thinkmarketingmaterial.co.uk" style="color:#07B5F2;font-weight:bold;">chelsea@thinkmarketingmaterial.co.uk</a> or myself direct on <a href="#" title="send email to ian@thinkmarketingmaterial.co.uk" style="color:#07B5F2;font-weight:bold;">ian@thinkmarketingmaterial.co.uk</a>
								<br/><br/>
									We pride ourselves on fast efficient service - ask any other IVC Practice - and most orders will be sent about 7 days from order or artwork sign off. We like to feel we are an extension of the IVC team - so feel free to ask us about anything where marketing or business advice is needed.
								<br/><br/>
									We have also invented <span style="color:#07B5F2">&#39;Planned Print&#39;</span> on top of &#39;Print Now&#39; <span style="color:#07B5F2">to give you up to 40% saving on a range of print material - </span>this is where we batch IVC jobs and print them together to save on cost. Such items take a little longer (up to 4 weeks) but are items you can plan in advance and order ahead - such as stationery items - example price list attached.
								<br/><br/>
									We understand that any change is hard going . To help relieve the burden we have agreed with <span style="color:#07B5F2">IVC to send you some standard items when you first join the group. These are the branded Client Charter to display in reception, a generic &#39;How are we doing&#39; poster to record your results to display to staff and a Legal Sign </span>that has to be on display where clients can view it .
								<br/><br/>
								<span p style="color:#E91796">
									Most Practices also want a matching stationery set of Letter Heads, Compliment Slips and Appointment Cards but we prefer to check with you that these are needed from the start. Please confirm OK and you will first receive an artwork proof from one of our designers and then 1000 of each of these to start you off - we will place order through our low cost Planned Print system.
								</span>
								<br/><br/>
									To keep transport costs to a minimum we send all materials to a single site within your group. Therefore if you are a multi-site group <span style="color:#07B5F2; font-weight:bold;">please e mail us to let us know what Practice you want goods delivered to - if you have more than one. Can you also confirm who should be our main contact with you.</span>
								<br/><br/>
									Myself, or one of our team, always attend the IVC quarterly Marketing Meetings to contribute - so hope to you meet you there soon - but in the meantime if there is ANYTHING we can help you with just e mail me on - <a href="#" title="send email to ian@thinkmarketingmaterial.co.uk" style="color:#07B5F2;font-weight:bold;">ian@thinkmarketingmaterial.co.uk </a>or call us on <span style="color:#07B5F2;font-weight:bold;">01794 522638.</span>
								<br/><br/>
									Again welcome and we look forward to working closely with you in the coming months.
